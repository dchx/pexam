================================================================================
In this text, I would like to include the basic instructions for
the processing and grading of departamental exams. This is not intended
to be a 100% error proof manual, and do not contains all of the
possible situations. Is based in my style of doing things and I agree
it may not be the best style. Please communicate with each other and
use the notes you took when I explained this in front of the terminal as
a complement. 
In my experience, only a few exams of practice,
some patience and a careful selection of file names will help to avoid 
problems. Please feel free to write any comments or suggestion for improvements
in a personal log and do not hesitate in asking Brent of Dr. Oliver for help. I
will be absent for almost all summer A period, I may read email, but do not trust
me on this. Is better to think I'm not available. I'll be here in Summer B, and
it may be good to collect all suggestions for improvements (logs). Then, we can
improve our software and have a better way to handle exams during the next year.

Is also important that you take some time to start practicing and mastering
the process, to be sure that you have enough paper to print exams and that
you have a log or some way of remembering what you did and how you did it.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.0 ORGANIZATION OF FILES

         The directory /depot/exam/

Is the root (main) folder in which we store and process all of the exams.
If you still do not have a permission for writting in /depot/exam, please
ask Brent for that permission. It is important that you DO NOT start
to write or overwrite any files unless you have read or at least be sure
that you understand what you are doing. For learning purposes, my first
suggestion is that you create a scratch folder and practice there until
you master the basic steps. DO NOT keep any files or process any exams
in your personal account. Is not secure and filenames can be forgotten
and lost, and could be very confusing to search for a file all over the
departamental net in case of urgent need for help.  

In /depot/exam/, all the exams are catalogued according to the semester
and course, and also by exam number and section:

Let say for example that we have to process exams for Professor Johnny P. Doe,
who is in charge of teaching the famous course BEERS AND DINOSAURS, and
has 320 students enrolled in two sections, 0998 and 0999. He will have
3 middle terms and one final exam.

Then, what we agreed to do is to use the nest notation:

		In /depot/exam, we create a folder for the course.

The code for summer will be "s" (we use "w" for spring and "f" for fall), the
year is 2000 and we are going to use the name of the course and the nickname
for the folder: (B)eers (A)nd (D)inosaurs. We could also use JPD for the name
of the professor. The latter is a better idea if several professors are
teaching the same course.

So we create a folder:

	> mkdir BADs00
	         ^ ^ ^
	         | | |_____________ Year
	         | |_______________ Summer
	         |_________________ Course


and for each section and exam, we create one subfolder, inside the folder we
just created:

	> cd BADs00
	> mkdir 0999_1
	          ^  ^ 
	          |  |______________ Exam Number
	          |_________________ Section Number



So we have a unique way to find the first exam of summer for Beers and Dinosaurs,
section 0998:  /depot/exam/BADs00/0998_1/


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.1 COMMON FILES

There is another important folder in /depot/exam and is the folder named
as /common. This folder contains the basic files the software uses to
create a TeX version of an exam, right now I am only going to list and
describe quickly the files, just for a reference. In the next sections we
will know what are thay used for:

		>cd /depot/exam/common

		file 1 : 1stPageBody.txt

		This generates the first page of the test header when using
		the program makehead.pl. You will need to COPY (not to move)
		this file lately.

		file 2 : 2nd PageBody.txt

		This generates the second page of the test header when using
		the program makehead.pl. You will need to COPY (not to move)
		this file lately.

		file 3: deflist.tex

		This contains the TeX macros we use for the TeX version of
		an exam. Do not move this file. You will link it to your
		test lately.

		file 4: makehead.pl

		This executable is a PERL program created by Dr. Oliver and
		helps us to generate a header (2 pages) containing the 
		instructions and information in a test. 

		file 5: qq2tex.pl

		This executable is another PERL program creted by Dr. Oliver
		and helps us to create a TeX readable version of the
		ascii question file sent by the professor.

		file 6: map.ps

		This is a postscript figure containing a little map that
		students use to locate their grades in the BSSC building.
		Do not move this file. Is already linked from the header files.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.0 RECEIVING A QUESTION FILE

Each faculty member will send you an email containing an ascii file. THe
ascii file is the main text of an exam. The files are sent to  an
special account called exam@astro.ufl.edu, which sends the files to the
group. If you are not included in the exam@astro alias, or you are not sure,
ask Brent to include you.

An ASCII question file may look like this:

 once you save it in /depot/exam  (the best email tool is PINE in this case)
and visualize it with an ascii text editor  ("nedit", "pico", or "vi"; gedit or
any windows based ascii editor are not very suitable and may lead
to compatibility errors):


QQ Astronomers generally use telescope because of
AA S 1 (1) light gathering power (2) ability to magnify (3)
ability to  make objects appear closer (4) they can see
stars in the daytime (5) ability to make things appear
larger
QQ To get the sharpest view of Jupiter or Saturn we want
 the best resolving power we can get.  We should observe
with
AA S 1 (1) a large telescope (2) a small telescope
 (3) binoculars (4) the naked eye (5) any refracting
telescope
QQ The asteroids have orbits which
AA S 1 (1) are mostly between Mars and Jupiter (2) very
elongated (3) mostly not in the ecliptic plane (4) are
similar to comets (5) are retrograde


Each QQ means QUESTION, each AA means an answer list.

After AA there is, sometimes an "S" That means that the question
needs to be stacked, one possible answer per line in the final text. A lack
of a S can mean two things: 1 that the professor does not need that
question stacked or 2 that he/she forgot to put the S. IN the latter case,
if you think it may be better to stack the answers as they are too long
to be contained into a single line, add the S by yourself.

THREE IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK FOR IN THE ASCII FILE:

one) Each AA group must contains 5 (FIVE) answers, NO MORE, NO LESS. THey
must be numbered from 1 to 5 and each number must be embraced in parenthesis
and before and after a parenthesis there must be at least ONE space, like


AA S 3 (1) the answer text
^ ^ ^ ^^ ^^    
| | | || ||__________________ space
| | | || |___________________ right parenthesis
| | | ||_____________________ left parenthesis
| | | |______________________ space
| | |________________________ space (only in first answer)
| |__________________________ space (only in first answer)  
|____________________________ AA only in first answer

Any variations from the last format may lead to possible qq2tex.pl errors.

two) the faculty member must avoid to use the TAB key to generate
spaces in the question text. Ask them, if you must, to use ONLY
the space bar to generate spaces in their texts. BEsides that,
it is important that each line in the ascii file is NO LONGER than
70 (SEVENTY) characters, otherwise, you may need a lot of extra time
making lines shorter to make them fit in the TeX format. 


three) Look for things like "fill the blanK" symbols like ___ because
TeX do not read those. Change them for $\_\_\_\_\_$. Look for
percentage "%" symbols. Change them by "\%", Other wise TeX interprets
them as "end of line" flags.


If the question file sent by the professor does not follow the described
format, ask the professor to re-sent the file in the correct format.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.0 GENERATING A PROOF

Step by step:


step 1) Copy the file sent by the professor into the corresponding folder.
Erase the original file from your root or mail folder.

Use the following format for the filename:

(In this example, we list the first exam for "Beers and Dinosaurs",
section 0998, exam 1. "whatever.file" is the file sent by the professor
as described in section 2.0)

 
		>cp whatever.file /depot/exam/BADs00/0998_1/s00bad1a.q

		>cd /depot/exam/BADs00/0998_1/

		>ls

		the machine must list one file:

		>s00bad1a.q
		 |____|^^ ^
		    |  || |________ extension .q is used for raw ascii file
		    |  ||__________ section 0998 identified as "a"
		    |  |___________ exam no. 1
		    |______________ you shoul know what this means by now
		
		
		
step 2) copy the necesary files:

	GET INTO /common folder:

	>cp *.dy.txt ../BADs00/0998_1/  <---copy 1st and 2nd body text files
	>cp *.pl ../BADs00/0998_1/      <---copy PERL macros to your folder

if you get into your exam folder again, you may have a list with 5 files:

	>cd ../BADs00/0998_1
	>ls

	the computer spits:

	> 1stPageBody.txt 	qq2tex.pl* 	s00bad1a.q
	  2ndPageBody.txt 	makehead.pl*


step 3) run qq2tex:

	> perl qq2tex.pl

	the program will ask:

	>qq2tex (28FEB00 version):
	>Enter the question file name: 

	there you write of course, s00bad1a.q

	and press enter.

If the question file contains 10 questions and the ascii format was
correct, you may have a message like:

	> QQ: 10 AA: 10 errors: 0

If it is not correct, the program will spit the locations of the possible
format errors in the ascii (.q) file. IN that case, you will need to
open the file in a text editor, correct the format errors and try again
the step 3 until you have a good message.


If you list again your files you may have a new file:

		s00bad1a.qu  <<< this is your re-formatted ascii file.
		                 notice the extension: .qu

Step 4) The header. This one is easy: Run makehead.pl:

	> perl makehead.pl


	The computer will ask you, ONE BY ONE for the exam details


	Let say that section 0998 for Beers and Dinosaurs is listed
	in the catalog as AST9555, periods MWF5-6

	Course number: AST9555
	Section: 0998
	Semester: Summer
	Year: 2000
	Periods: MWF5-6
	Instructor: Dr. John Doe
	Exam Date: August 32th, 2000
	Exam Number: 1
	Testform: A               <------ see below
	Special Code: 09          <------ see below
	Time limit: 50            <------ see below
	Number of questions: 10

Enter the desired header file name: s00bad1a.hed <---- see below

Testform:  This is an older but useful code used to avoid confusions:
	Exam 1 has code A, exam 2 has code B, etc., and trhere is a
	maximum of 4 midterms (A,B,C,D) and one final (form E).

Special Code:  You need an special code for each course and
		section. In this case, section 0998 has code 09,
		then section 0999 has code 19,and if there
		are mores sections for a single professor, we would
		use 29,39, etc.

		The actual codes we have are as next:

		Oliver: code 7 (07,17, etc)
		Cohen: code 6 (06,16...)
		Gottesman: code 2
		Lebo: Code 4
		Leacock: Code 3
		Smith: Code 5

		And it may be good to keep using the same codes, right?

Time Limit: Indicates time allowed for the test IN MINUTES. Ask Dr. OLiver
or the faculty member for allowed times during summer semester.


NOw you have a header file named: s00bad1a.hed.

OPEN YOUR .qu file WITH ANY TEXT EDITOR YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH (vi, pico,nedit).

You need to add 1 line AT THE BEGGINING OF THE FILE:

\input s00bad1a.hed
^
|______Don't forget this slash symbol!


You need to add 3 lines AT THE END OF THE FILE, after the very last
embrace ("}") symbol:

\EQ
\vfill\eject
\evenpages

Don't forget this last step. IS CRUCIAL to have separate tests.


Save and close your text editor. YOur file is ready to process, so give it
a "name", which is, change its extension:


		>mv s00bad1a.qu s00bad1a.que

the .que extension means a file that you can run into TEXAM, our principal
software.

Once you have your .que file, run TEXAM:

		> texam s00bad1a.que

the computer will spit:


NUMARGS=  1
  ARG  = s00bad1a.que
 THE QUESTION FILE CONTAINS 40 QUESTIONS
  1 QUESTION FILE NAME                      s00bad1a.que
  2 RAND NUMBER/ANS FILE                    s00bad1a.ans
  3 MASTER/ STATISTICS  OUTPUT FILE         s00bad1a.tex
  4 STUDENT ANSWER FILE                     s00bad1a.san
  5 STUDENT GRADE FILE                      s00bad1a.gra

 11 1.0 12 1.0 13 1.0 14 1.0 15 1.0 16 1.0 17 1.0 18 1.0 19 1.0 20 1.0

  ENTER THE LINE NUMBER, CHANGE, CHANGE, TO CHANGE A LINE
  ENTER S TO STOP
  ENTER (CARRIAGE RETURN <CR>) IF EVERYTHING IS OK


The numbers 1 to 15 are your options and you can change them by typing
 
optionnumber newvalue   <ENTER>

for example, we always prefer option 15, space between questions as 2, so
we say

15 2  

don't forget to press enter!

For the proof, leave everything as it is, except maybe for this option.

Press enter again to go out from TEXAM.

You may have a bunch of new files. Don't worry about that:

The files you like now are:

s00bad1a.tex
s00bad1a.ans

the proof is contains the master exam, with all the correct answers
as marked by the professor (normally 1 is the correct answer). Clone
the files mentioned to a master copy:

		>cp s00bad1a.tex master.tex
		>cp s00bad1a.ans master.ans

OPEN THE master.tex file with your favorite text editor and include the
next line as the FIRST LINE:


\input /depot/exam/common/deflist.tex


save and close.

Now you can run TeX to generate the proof.

		> tex master.tex


In an ideal case, tex will throw a few lines of garbage and leave your
prompt clean. I don't know how to consider here all of the possible errors
from TeX. It could be millions, or just one. Lost? The best, is to ASK. ASK
Brent, or another TeX literate student. The most common errors are too long
lines or ___ fill the blanks symbols or % percentage signs without
a format. See last paragraphs of section 2.0.


Visualize your proof:

		> xdvi master.dvi

If everything is nice and smooth, you will see a viewer with a nice
exam, 2 header pages and at the top, a number 0. Check the text of
the header for possible typos in the section, group, date, etcetera. Look
at the text for possible black squares or funny things that you may
correct at the .que file (do not correct the tex file because that one
is overwritten everytime you run texam).

Print a hardcopy of the final proof after corrections:

		> dvips master.dvi

(if you say "dvips master.dvi -o", the proof is copied to a postscript
file first)

Print a hardcopy of the master answers file

		> lpr master.ans

Staple all. Take the proof/master to the faculty member's mailbox. Do this
at least two days in advance, the professor may sent more corrections.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4.0 GENERATING AN EXAM

It would be foolish to repeat here step by step all the text from section 3.0.

To generate an exam, once you corrected your s00bad1a.que file with the
corrections suggested by the faculty after they read the proof:

run texam on s00bad1a.que . REMEMBER. Make in this file the corrections
from the faculty: master.que is just the master and you may generate is
again, if necesary, as a clone of w00bad1a.que.


change the options 6 (instead of proof, say "exam"), 10 (put here, instead
of 1, the number of exams the professor told you to generate) and 15
(space between questions is 2, not 4).

get out from TEXAM by pressing enter again.

add a first line to s00bad1a.tex:

\input /depot/exam/common/deflist.tex


save and close.

run TeX on this file

		> tex s00bad1a.tex

no errors? Good. visualize your exam:

		> xdvi s00bad1a.dvi

the dvi visualizer should show you the exam itself with as many copies
as you told texam to generate. The test number is at the top of each page.
Check that

		a) the second page is blank
		b) the number of pages for each test is EVEN.


quit the dvi window. You are ready to print th exam. Be sure that you
are plenty of paper, staples and at least 1 minute of time for each 30
pages generated. And extra time for stapling! The first time you do this,
you may generate the ps copy and print from a ghostview visualizer.

Be sure that the file

S00bad1a.ans

is safe and that it contains the correct answers for the
"n" exams you generated. 


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5.0 The bubble sheets and OIR.


Once you printed, STAPLED, collated, proctored, recollected and have a bunch
of test scantron bubble sheets with the student's answers. Put them inside
a blank sheet of paper (like a taco), put it together with a rubber band and
take it to the ground floor of the turlington Hall. 

There are several personal working at the OIR office. They are normally
in not a very good mood. Please try to be clear to avoid
confusions. They are going to ask you for the next data:


Name: Give them your LAST name

Department: Astronomy 

Telephone: give them your office phone number

Course : Say AST 1002

User ID: MSCXAM

filename: Use same notation: say "s00bad1a"


In 45 minutes, more or less, you will be able to retrieve a file
called S00BAD1A.OIR from the OIR computer. Here are the instructions
to get the file:


5.1 RECEIVING OIR FILES


in a terminal, type

		> x3270 &

to get a 3270 type terminal. Is black. With the mouse go to the
connect option and select "other".

It will open a small window asking for a computer name:

write          nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu

press enter and then the terminal will take you to a system where
you will be asked for name and password:

		name: mscxam
		password: regina

once you are in, type

begin    <press enter>
rl       <press enter>


and you will see a list of files printed in green. Get the file(s) you
need by moving up or down the list with the arrow keys of your keyboard
and selecting the file with the F9 key. Once you got all you need, press
F3 to quit.

type    logoff

and with  yur mouse, select file and the option "exit".
The terminal will disappear.

Now the files are in anothjer computer in an ftp site. 

FIRST, go to the folder WHER YOU WANT TO PUT THE FILES, maybe /depot/exam
so you can move them to the corrsponding folders later.

		> cd /depot/exam
		> ftp nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu

		type mscxam and regina as name and password respectively

		> ascii
		> mget S00BAD1A.OIR     (or whatever file you need)
		> quit


You now may have the .OIR file in your account.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6.0 GENERATING GRADE FILES.

Step 1) Copy the OIR file you got from nervm.nerdc.ufl.edu (see section 5.1)
        to the corresponding folder and put it the extension .san

		> cp s00BAD1A.OIR /depot/exam/BADs00/0998_1/s00bad1a.san

the .san (or .OIR) file you have contains all of the information from the
green bubble sheets. 

Step 2) Clone the .que and the .ans files from step 4.0.
        I use the same names, just without the "s00":

		> cp s00bad1a.que bad1a.que
		> cp s00bad1a.ans bad1a.ans
		> cp s00bad1a.san bad1a.san

This is important. The .ans file will be overwritten and your only copy
will be the original w00bad1a.ans.


Run TEXAM on bad1a.que. As you already generated bad1a.san and bad1a.ans
the only optins you may change are 

15 (2 spaces),
10 (again, PUT HERE THE NUMBER OF EXAMS YOU GENERATED ORIGINALLY, AND NOT,
           I REPEAT, NOT THE NUMBER OF EXAMS YOU GRADED)

6 grade (instead of exam or proof, now it is grade, REMEMBER. Grade.
        one more time!: grade)

Are you sure you said "grade" and not "exam" or "proof"? Good. Double check
again that you put the correct number of exams and that you said
grade and not proof or exam. OK. As we said in Mexico "after advise there
is not lying".


Press enter to generate the grades.

edit the newly generated

bad1a.tex


cut all of the garbage, which is the exam text again. At the end of that,
you will find all of the statistics for the grading, including, the
names, the correct answers, the answers from each student for each questions,
reliabilities, scores, etc. Check that everything looks fine. WARNING,
this is not a TeX file, even if it has a .tex extension.


save the cut version of bad1a.tex.

you have also another .ans file, but it contains now, a plot
of the grade distribution. And there is a .gra file. Those are the raw
grades ans that is the file you may be asked to post. Maybe you need to
print this file and fold or cut the paper to avoid posting names or SSN's.

Using PINE or your favorite mailtool, send to the professor those
three files:

bad1a.tex
bad1a.gra
bad1a.ans



 Guess what, you are done.
 
 
 
 After everything is happy again, etcetera. AND AFTER YOU DON'T NEED
 ANY MORE CORRECTIONS, erase from the
 folder the next list of files:
 
 
 -all of the files from the /common folder. We don't need that many copies
 -all of the .dvi, .log. and even the .tex files (you can generate those
 from the .que 
 -all of the ps files you may generated. 
 
 Is important to erase non-necesary files because /depot is shared
 with other departamental sotfware and the space is thus, somewhat limited.
 THe normal load of space is left after erases is around 70-250 Kb per
 exam depending on the size of the .que files.
 
 
 HAVE FUN
 HAVE A NICE SUMMER...
