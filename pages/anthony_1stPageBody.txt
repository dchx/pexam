\par Due to student privacy laws, the scores will be posted by the five
digit code found in the upper left corner of each page. Each exam has a
UNIQUE code number.  However, other Astronomy sections use this exam format
and may use the same exam code numbers. IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT
YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE SCORE YOU READ BELONGS TO YOU. The instructor's name
and the exam number will be clearly marked on each exam score listing.
\bigskip 
\par As you turn in your exam, tear off this page and save it for future
reference.  It will aid you in finding your score when the exam scores
are posted.  Also, should you have any questions about the exam after it is
graded, the loss of this page will make it difficult to find your exam and
delay possible ( but unlikely ) changes to your grade.  Should you have any
questions, this page MUST be brought with you as a means of identification.
